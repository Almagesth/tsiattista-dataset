Tsiattista Muse: Cypriot Poetry Dataset for LLM Generation



Tsiattista Muse is a curated dataset of 50 Cypriot tsiattista poems, paired with a Python script for Supabase integration and a Flask-based web interface to showcase AI-generated tsiattista poetry. Developed by Evangelia Bompola (Almagesth), this project preserves Cypriot cultural heritage through data curation, database management, and web development, enabling applications in AI training, natural language processing (NLP), and academic research.
